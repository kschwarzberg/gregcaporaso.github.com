  My PhD dissertation research in the UC San Diego/San Diego State University
  joint doctoral program combined bioinformatics methods and molecular biology
  to study oral polymicrobial communities and impact on human health. As a
  postdoctoral scholar in the Caporaso Lab, I am working on the impact of
  probiotics on the human gut microbiome in individuals with Autism Spectrum
  Disorders. In addition, I am working on benchmarking some of the standard
  approaches for analyzing metagenomic data.
