  My dissertation research at Michigan State University focused on the
  evolution of genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) within the
  family Hyaenidae and the implications of MHC diversity on reproduction and
  survival. In my current position as a Postdoctoral scholar at NAU, I use
  bioinformatics and comparative bacterial genomics to address questions
  related to bacterial pathogens and microbial diversity.
