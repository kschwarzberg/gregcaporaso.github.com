# What I do

I'm primarily involved in the development of open source bioinformatics tools,
including [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org) and [QIIME](http://qiime.org).
I'm an active GitHub user; to see what I'm up to, check out my profile:
[@jairideout](https://github.com/jairideout). I also perform data analysis,
write manuscripts, and teach QIIME/microbial ecology workshops.

# What I'm interested in

Bioinformatics is a very new and rapidly growing field. In response to the
enormous influx of sequencing data over the past few years, there has been an
explosion in the sheer number of bioinformatics tools, file formats, protocols,
and techniques that are in use. In this extremely fast-paced environment,
quality is often sacrificed for quantity and immediate results. I firmly
believe that there is a strong need for the application of software engineering
"best practices" within bioinformatics in order to keep developers, users, and
maintainers sane, as well as to keep science and awesome research pushing
forward.

I am interested in applying these software engineering "best practices" to
real-world, nontrivial bioinformatics projects. By embracing techniques such as
automated testing, continuous integration, test-driven development, the code
review process, and release management, I hope to **make people's lives
easier** and **reduce technical debt**.

I am also passionate about designing bioinformatics library APIs that are
clean, simple, intuitive, and extremely well-documented.

I am able to realize both of these interests through
[scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org). I'm extremely excited about this project
because we have been able to build the library from the ground up using these
software engineering "best practices." We have also focused on designing a
simple (but powerful!) API for researchers and data analysts who may not
necessarily have a strong technical background. I hope that scikit-bio will set
a precedent for the development of future bioinformatics software.
