  I am interested in the molecular evolution and epidemiology of biomedically
  relevant bacteria and viruses. My work at NAU involves studying intra-patient
  evolution of Burkholderia pseudomallei, geographic and temporal distribution
  of Coxiella burnetti and Bacillus anthracis, as well as development of a
  pipeline to achieve strain level resolution in metagenomics analysis.
