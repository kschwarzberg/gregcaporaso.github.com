  I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and
  Assistant Director of the Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics at
  Northern Arizona University. My research interests are focused on
  understanding how the communities of micro-organisms that live in and on our
  bodies, and who cohabit our homes and offices, affect human health, and
  ultimately how we can use that understanding to improve human health by
  developing microbiome-based treatments of disease. Toward this end, my lab
  develops software and methods for studying microbial ecology.
