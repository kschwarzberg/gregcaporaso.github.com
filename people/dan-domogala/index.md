  I am a graduate student pursuing my master's in biology at Northern Arizona
  University. My project aims to understand the structure and function of the
  microbiome in the gut of surgeonfish species. Members of the surgeonfish
  microbiome we are studying include "epulos" species, which are among the
  largest Eubacteria.

The surgeonfish microbiome, unlike the human microbiome has not been effected by antibiotic treatments, dietary practices, pollutants, or high density populations. In order to analyze the community structure
of the surgeonfish microbiome I will be using high throughput sequencing and downstream analysis using QIIME version 1.7.0.

Questions that we intend to address:

 + Will there be any degree of variability between the stomach, intestine, and across the length of the intestine, despite interspecific differences in the microbial composition?
 + What are the identities and functions of inhabitants in the fish gut microbiome, and are changes due to circadian shifts consistent and predictable?
 + Are patterns observed in the data consistent across host taxon, geographic distribution, difference in food source, or presence/absence of epulos?


The project outcome hopes to provide information about evolutionary relationships and their functions in the fish gut microbiome."
