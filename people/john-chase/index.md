  I recently received a master’s degree in Biology from Northern Arizona
  University. My undergraduate degrees from NAU are in Biology and Sociology
  with minors in Chemistry and Spanish. My interests are primarily genetics and
  bioinformatics. My master’s thesis consisted of taking samples from offices
  in Flagstaff, San Diego and Toronto. The 16S rRNA gene of the samples were
  sequenced and the bacterial communities were profiled. Extensive time series
  data was collected as well. I am currently analyzing the data and attempting
  to apply new statistical techniques not commonly used in microbial ecology
  such as generalized linear models. I am also involved in developing
