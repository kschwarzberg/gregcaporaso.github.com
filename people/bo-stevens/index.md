  I am a Masters student in Biology at NAU. I am interested in bioinformatics,
  ecology, remote sensing, microbiology, and the public perception of complex
  and novel scientific issues. For my thesis, I am working with the Nancy
  Johnson Lab to elicit patterns of bacterial and fungal communities within the
  Serengeti grasslands. In addition, I am conducting an analysis of the
  presence of bias among published literature on the topic of genetic
  modification.
